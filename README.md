# Tangible Interaction with Busts and Statues

This readme will contain a full documentation of the prototyping work that was done for the master thesis to create the prototypes for the plaster bust of the head of Ludwig I. as well as the miniature statues. Alongside all of the findings of the author of things that did or did not work and some dos and don'ts will be shared.

## Silicone mold for the bust of Ludwig I. and plaster castings

In this section it will be described gradually how a silicone mold was created from the original Ludwig bust from the Staatliche Antikensammlung and how it was used to make further plaster castings.

The first step was to cut out a base plate (in this case made out of wood) where the head can rest on. In order to fixate the head onto the board and to prevent any silicone from leaking under the head before it fully cures Plasticine (a sort of modeling clay) was used. In order for it to be malleable it was put in the microwave for a short period of time which made working with it way easier. Then the clay was used to seal all of the crevices between the head and the base plate (see figure below).

The next step was to build a wooden case around the bust to build a vessel for the silicone. This can be seen on the figure below.

The silicone that was used is a SF33 - RTV2 silicone. This type of silicone is milky-transparent, very durable and heat-resistant. It’s a silicone that is made for making silicone molds and it consists of two parts:
* A base
* A catalyst
Once these two parts are properly mixed in a 1:1 ratio the silicone cures in around 3 hours at room temperature. Higher temperatures speed up the curing process. Normal silicone needs air to cure which would have been problematic here because the final mold is quite thick. The "SF33" means that its Shore hardness is "33" so it’s medium-hard. For this project 10 kg of silicone were used. But before the silicone got poured inside the vessel a thin layer of it was applied on the whole bust by using small brush. This way it is ensured that there get no air bubbles trapped in between the plaster and the silicone. After this thin layer was dried the rest of the silicone got poured inside the vessel. The following figure shows the silicone mold once it was cured.
